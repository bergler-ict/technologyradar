Threat modeling,ADOPT,Techniques,FALSE,"See our <a href=""https://www.bergler.nl/threat-modeling/"" target=""_blank"">blog post</a> about this topic. <br/><br/> Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”. Conceptually, most people incorporate some form of threat modeling in their daily life and don't even realize it. Commuters use threat modeling to consider what might go wrong during the morning drive to work and to take preemptive action to avoid possible accidents. Children engage in threat modeling when determining the best path toward an intended goal while avoiding the playground bully. In a more formal sense, threat modeling has been used to prioritize military defensive preparations since antiquity."
Future proof software development,ADOPT,Techniques,TRUE,"See our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHZa6LsxZwY"" target=""_blank"">video</a> about this topic. <br/><br/>The world of software development has always been a place of rapid change. However the last decade the rate of change has drastically accelerated. On the one hand Agile processes have led us to ever increasing our rate of releasing. On the other hand developing multi-platform has opened a world of additional tools and practices that developers need to get acquainted with. How do we handle these circumstances? Those questions is what future proof software development attempts to address."

The name comes from a 2003 book by Eric Evans that describes the approach through a catalog of patterns. Since then a community of practitioners have further developed the ideas, spawning various other books and training courses. The approach is particularly suited to complex domains, where a lot of often-messy logic needs to be organized."
Infrastructure as code,ADOPT,Techniques,FALSE,"Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a version control system. It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches. It is advised to dive into this technology, it has been added to trial because of the impact on the organization not because it is not mature."
